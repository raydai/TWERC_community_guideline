## Thread Functionality

Please use thread functionality for discussions on related topics whenever possible.

## Share Relevant Content

Share content relevant to the channel's theme to help maintain the platform's content.

## No Spam or Deceptive Behavior

TWERC is built on trust, so we prohibit content that intends to defraud, mislead, or deceive other users, as well as the distribution of spam or any unnecessary disruptions to other community members.

## Sensitive Content

TWERC is committed to protecting the eyes of all members. Therefore, please refrain from sharing explicit, nudity, and self-harm content.

TWERC prohibits hate speech, predatory behavior, graphic violence, malicious attacks, and content that advocates harmful or dangerous actions.

## False Information

After three warnings for violations, user accounts will be removed.

Our stance is to encourage and welcome the participation of researchers with diverse and wide-ranging professional backgrounds, making the Tulane R community more diverse and inclusive. Regardless of members' experiences, gender identities, races, ages, nationalities, sexual orientations, appearances, disabilities, body shapes, or other characteristics, our goal is to maintain a safe, supportive, and friendly research-oriented community for all members. The following regulations and related actions can be applied to the following unacceptable behaviors or actions that negatively impact the community or members' safety and well-being, whether the violation occurs within or outside this community's related activities, including online or in-person community-related events and one-on-one communication.

## Expected Behavior

- Be friendly.
- Be patient.
- Be welcoming.
- Be respectful.
- Exercise caution in speech.
- When in disagreement, try to understand or respect others' perspectives. We encourage constructive resolution of differences and diverse viewpoints. Not understanding someone's perspective does not mean they are wrong. Remember, making mistakes is human; blaming each other won't bring any benefits. Instead, focus on helping to solve problems and learn from mistakes.
- Be attentive and supportive of each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Behaviors or comments that may be seen as gender discrimination, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ability discrimination, or other discriminatory or offensive behavior.
- Unwanted, suggestive, derogatory, or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Disrespecting others (jokes, insinuations, condescension).
- Harassment or bullying (online or in-person). Please read the "Code of Conduct" to understand how we interpret harassment.
- Disrespect for differences of opinion.
- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be mindful of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, please stop.
- Failure to understand the difference between constructive criticism and belittlement.
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language.

## Behavioral Measures

All members should understand that speech and behavior have consequences, and the community cannot tolerate the above unacceptable behavior. If you encounter anyone violating the code of conduct or are a witness to such behavior, please contact us by submitting a form [here](#) or by sending an email to [ksu2@tulane.edu](mailto:ksu2@tulane.edu), [baponterolon@tulane.edu](mailto:baponterolon@tulane.edu), and [efarrer@tulane.edu](mailto:efarrer@tulane.edu).
